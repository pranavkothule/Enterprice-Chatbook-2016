        You may submit content, including text, images, photographs and video to the eLchat Social Networks (collectively, “User Generated Content”), provided that you abide by these common sense rules:
      
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>If you post it, you own it</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
      Think twice before you publish. Would you want your family, friends, colleagues, or others to read or see the content you post? Keep in mind that even if original content can be deleted, the content that is shared and distributed through an array of channels can be reposted, searched, and found on the Internet.
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>Respect the law, including with regard to intellectual property</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      It is critical that you show proper respect for the law generally, and specifically for the laws governing copyright and fair use of copyrighted material. You should not quote more than short excerpts from someone else’s work. It is good general practice to link to others’ work. Use appropriate symbols to mark the first appearance of trademarked terms in your content. Do not post images, music or other copyrighted content unless you own them or have permission from the owner to display such content in this context. Keep in mind that the laws may differ depending on where you live.
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>Treat others like you want to be treated</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>
  Be respectful of others’ opinions and beliefs. Use common courtesy when posting content: refrain from abusive, obscene, or offensive language, images, or links. Do not post content from, or links to, Internet sites that feature sexual content, gambling, or that advocate intolerance of others; and do not create such content on eLchat’s Social Networks.
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>Do not post confidential or proprietary information</li>
      </ul>
      </li></li >
      <li>
        By posting content to eLchat’s Social Networks, you are agreeing to allow anyone with access to eLchat’s Social Networks to access it and use it without restriction, except with regard to any applicable intellectual property rights that you or others may have in such content. You agree that you will not post or transmit material that is confidential or proprietary to you or a third-party.
